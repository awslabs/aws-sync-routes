Architecture Architecture diagram Infrastructure as code diagram Prerequisites NodeJS 8.11+ or 10.15+ AWS CLI Configured AWS CLI profile AWS Amplify CLI toolchain For Windows users Windows Subsystem for Linux Getting Started Run amplify env add , which will: Map your AWS CLI profile to a new AWS Amplify environment NOTE: The default AWS region specified for your AWS CLI profile will be used, such as us-east-1 . Update the value (temporarily or otherwise) if you want the resources deployed elsewhere. Deploy the root CloudFormation stack , which includes the following default resources for an AWS Amplify CLI managed project: S3 deployment bucket CloudFormation root stack IAM AuthRole IAM UnauthRole Create: ./amplify/team-provider-info.json : Specifies the names and ARNs of the resources in the root stack for your environment. IMPORTANT : Do not submit pull requests with your ./amplify/team-provider-info.json file. Again, it contains information about your environment's resources. This file should be committed in your private repo and was intentionally excluded from ./.gitignore . If you updated the default region for your AWS CLI profile and want to change it back, you can do so once this file exists because all of the other resources will be deployed to the region specified in this file. ./amplify/backend/amplify-meta.json : Compiled from ./amplify/backend/backend-config.json and ./amplify/team-provider-info.json . Specifies: The managed backend categories Their dependencies Deployment information ./amplify/#current-cloud-backend/ : Directory containing the compiled version of the environment. ./src/aws-exports.js : Covered in the next step. The example below specifies an environment name of dev , an editor of None , and the default AWS CLI profile. Adjust these for your use case. $ amplify env add Note: It is recommended to run this command from the root of your app directory ? Enter a name for the environment dev ?

One way to do this: aws apigateway get-api-keys : Copy the id value for the next command. aws apigateway get-api-key --include-value --api-key id : Copy the value value. Now, you are ready to test the API endpoint.

Is not a propagated route . Has an ENI target. Is in an active state in the main route table. Usage There is only one API endpoint with two path parameters: /vpcs/ vpc id /route-tables/ route table id with a HTTP PATCH request method . NOTE: This implementation does not follow all of the RFC5789 specifications for a HTTP PATCH method- it does not use a PATCH document and it is idempotent. Path parameter Required Description Example 1 Example 2 vpc id true ID of the VPC . vpc-01234567 vpc-0123456789abcdef0 route table id true ID of the VPC's main route table . rtb-01234567 rtb-0123456789abcdef0 The request body schema has one required property: destination-cidr-block , and one optional property: dry-run . Property name Required Description Example 1 Example 2 destination-cidr-block true The IPv4 destination CIDR block for the route. 192.168.0.0/24 172.30.0.0/16 dry-run false Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response.

Adjust the burstLimit rateLimit values in parameters.json , then run amplify push to deploy the changes, and try again. Of note, the rate burst limits are only configured in the API token usage plan as described in the API Gateway CloudFormation template , not the API Gateway deployment stage. Throttling could be configured in both locations, but configuring this in both locations is unnecessary and the current configuration makes it easy to use additional API tokens if so desired. Request Limit Exceeded If you are syncing a batch of routes and start receiving Request Limit Exceeded error messages, this means that the requests are being throttled due to the number of requests in this region in this account within a set period of time. First try decreasing the frequency of API calls. If that is unteneble, please open an AWS Support ticket explaining the business case and request an increase to the limits for the following: EC2 describe route tables 1 call per request (sustained) EC2 create route 1 call per custom route table per request where the route exists in the main route table, but not in the custom route table (burst) In dry-run mode, this action will be called for every request since changes will not be executed, resulting in a higher likelihood of throttling EC2 replace route 1 call per custom route table per request where the route exists in both the main custom route table, but have different next hop values (burst) In dry-run mode, this action will be called for every request since changes will not be executed, resulting in a higher likelihood of throttling Project tree . \u251c\u2500\u2500 .github/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md \u251c\u2500\u2500 amplify/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 #current-cloud-backend/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 .config/ \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 local-aws-info.json \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 local-env-info.json \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 project-config.json \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 backend/ \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 api/ \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 awssyncroutes/ \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 awssyncroutes-cloudformation-template.json \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 parameters.json \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 awscloudformation/ \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 nested-cloudformation-stack.yml \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 function/ \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 awssyncroutes/ \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 dist/ \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 src/ \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 node_modules/ \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 app.js \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 index.js \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 package-lock.json \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 package.json \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 awssyncroutes-cloudformation-template.json \u2502 \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 parameters.json \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 amplify-meta.json \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 backend-config.json \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 team-provider-info.json \u251c\u2500\u2500 docs/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 about/ \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 contributing.md - ../../CONTRIBUTING.md \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 license.md - ../../LICENSE \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 adr/ \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 0001-record-architecture-decisions.md \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 0002-aws-amplify-cli-toolchain.md \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 0003-http-patch-method.md \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 0004-api-key.md \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 0005-uri.md \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 0006-specificity.md \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 Architecture.png - ../Architecture.png \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 InfrastructureAsCode.png - ../InfrastructureAsCode.png \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 index.md - ../README.md \u251c\u2500\u2500 material/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 assets/ \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 stylesheets/ \u2502 \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 application-palette.css \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 application.css \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 partials/ \u2502 \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 palette.html \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 main.html \u251c\u2500\u2500 scripts/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 aws-sync-routes-client.sh* \u251c\u2500\u2500 src/ \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 aws-exports.js \u251c\u2500\u2500 .adr-dir \u251c\u2500\u2500 .editorconfig \u251c\u2500\u2500 .eslintrc.js \u251c\u2500\u2500 .gitignore \u251c\u2500\u2500 .markdownlint.yml \u251c\u2500\u2500 Architecture.png \u251c\u2500\u2500 InfrastructureAsCode.png \u251c\u2500\u2500 LICENSE \u251c\u2500\u2500 NOTICE \u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md \u2514\u2500\u2500 mkdocs.yml The project tree was generated with the following command: tree -aFL 6 --dirsfirst --noreport -I .git|site|*-latest-build.zip License This library is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License .","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"#aws-sync-routes","text":"Synchronizes the specified route from the main/default route table to all custom route tables in the VPC .
