Please see the pricing guides for further details: AWS Lambda, AWS API Gateway, Amazon SNS, Amazon S3, Amazon CloudWatch Logs, &amp; CloudFormation.</p> <p>This is also an infrastructure as code solution, meaning that it should only require a few commands to deploy once the prerequisites are installed &amp; configured, and was designed so that it should not require much attention thereafter.</p> <p>Once deployed, the endpoint generally takes 1-3 seconds to execute when called, and is idempotent, so changes will only be implemented once when the specified route either does not exist in one or more custom route tables or the next hop value changes. Routes will not be programmatically removed by this solution.</p> <p>One customer success story to date is that this solution was used in us-east-1 to synchronize 26 production routes across 4 custom route tables (104 concurrent route synchronizations) with a 5 second polling interval. In testing, all route targets updated successfully within 4 seconds. This met the customer's requirement of completing all route synchronizations prior to timeout of a mission critical application at 15 seconds, and allowed them to complete a critical maintenance window.</p> <p>Please test thoroughly.</p>"},{"location":"#architecture","title":"Architecture","text":""},{"location":"#architecture-diagram","title":"Architecture diagram","text":""},{"location":"#infrastructure-as-code-diagram","title":"Infrastructure as code diagram","text":""},{"location":"#prerequisites","title":"Prerequisites","text":"<ul> <li>NodeJS</li> <li>AWS CLI<ul> <li>Configured AWS CLI profile</li> </ul> </li> <li>AWS Amplify CLI toolchain<ul> <li>NOTE: Interoperability between the AWS Amplify CLI and AWS CLI Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), as well as assume role with MFA, have been validated in testing per request.
